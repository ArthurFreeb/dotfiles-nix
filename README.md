# Homelab

This repository houses all the automation used for my homelab, as well as my dotfiles for all my personal machines.

My dotfiles are managed by Nix home manager and can be found within the `./home-manager` folder, if you wish to learn more about my dotfiles specifically please read the [Dotfiles README](./dotfiles.md).
